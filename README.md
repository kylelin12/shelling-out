# Shelling Out - Shell in C

by Kyle Lin

### Features:

* Forks children and executes commands from them
* Parses multiple commands in one line seperated by a `;`
* exit
* cd
* Signal handling
* Redirection using >, <
* Piping using |

### Attempt(ed/ing):

* Handling `CTRL + Z` aka SIGTSTP signal

### Bugs:

* <del>`echo <STRING>` Where STRING is really long cuts off and ends the
echo with an exclaimation mark.</del> **FIXED**
* Handling SIGTSTP doesn't work. After sending the SIGTSTP signal, program
starts repeatedly sending ">" to stdout.
* Randomly sends to STDOUT more than once
* When creating or deleting files, the "No such file/directory" error is returned
although the file is successfully added/removed.

### Files & Function Headers:

* parser.c : Parses the line
```
    /*======== char **parseargs() ==========
    Inputs: char *line
    Returns: Array of strings where each string is an argument of the command

    Dynamically allocates memory for a string array and for a copy of the input line.

    Iterates through a copy of the input line and uses strsep to find the ` ` space
    delimiter. The index by index, each returned pointer from strsep is places in
    consecutive indexes of the string array. 

    Returns the string array.
    ====================*/
```
* exec_commands.c : Executes commands
```
    /*======== int exec_commands() ==========
    Inputs: char **parsedargs
    Returns: 0

    Recursively goes through the input string array and executes commands based on
    the detection of either `;`, `>`, `<`, or `|` in the array.

    If nothing goes wrong, 0 is returned.
    ====================*/
```
* bash_shell.c : Reads from stdin and executes commands using exec_commands()
```
    /*======== int bash_shell() ==========
    Inputs: 
    Returns: 0 

    Runs rd_line() to read a line from stdin.
    Runs parseargs() to convert the line into a char **.
    Executes exit and cd if those are inputted using cnt_fork().
    Executes the non exit/cd commands using exec_commands().
    Returns 0 if nothing goes wrong.
    ====================*/

    /*======== void cnt_fork() ==========
    Inputs: char **
    Returns: void 

    Exception function for the exit and cd commands.
    If exit, exit(0).
    If cd, chdir(<Next Argument>).
    ====================*/

    /*======== char *rd_line() ==========
    Inputs: 
    Returns: Char pointer containing the input string 

    Allocates memory to a char pointer.
    Uses fgets() to read from stdin to the char pointer.
    Removes '\n' newlines.
    Returns the pointer.
    ====================*/

    /*======== void sighandler() ==========
    Inputs: int
    Returns: void 

    Takes an input int which is received from signal() in main().
    If SIGINT is the input, re-runs bash_shell() and clears the buffer.
    If SIGSTSP is the input, sends a SIGSTOP signal to the process. **Broken**
    ====================*/
```
* shell.c : Main file to run. Contains loop to run bash_shell()
```
    /*======== int main() ==========
    Inputs: 
    Returns: 0

    If nothing goes wrong, 0 is returned.
    ====================*/
